## Social Network API
This repository contains an API for a social network web application that uses a NoSQL database. The API is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and the Mongoose ODM. The purpose of this API is to handle large amounts of unstructured data, similar to what social networking platforms require.


## Description
In Module 18, we're learning how to make a social network API using a special kind of database called MongoDB. It helps the social network handle lots of information and is really flexible. We'll be using something called Express.js for making the different parts of our API, and Mongoose to connect to the database. We'll learn how to create and organize the API so that people can share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and have a list of friends.
